Crispy Pear
===========

What is it ?
------------
___
Crispy Pear is a javascript library to build games using HTML5 canvas. It is designed to be easy to integrate and to use.

It takes its inspirations from frameworks like [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/) or [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/).

* The [Spritools](http://jeremy.gabriele.free.fr/SpriteViewer/) enable you to :
> - Check if your spritesheet are running fine
> - Create spritesheets from multiple images
> - Explode a spritesheets in many images (so you can modify the frame that didn't fit nice, and use the tool just before to recreate your spritesheet)
